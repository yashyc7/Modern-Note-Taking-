# Modern Notes

**Modern Notes** is a sleek, feature-rich desktop note-taking application built with Python and Tkinter. Designed for Windows, it offers a modern, user-friendly interface with light and dark themes, supporting both traditional note-taking and task management. The app uses SQLite for persistent storage and is compiled into a standalone executable using PyInstaller for easy distribution.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Note Creation and Management**: Create, edit, save, and delete notes with titles and optional categories.
- **Task Lists**: Switch between standard notes and task list modes for managing to-do items with checkboxes.
- **Persistent Storage**: Notes and tasks are saved in a local SQLite database (`notes.db`), ensuring data persists across sessions.
- **Search and Filter**: Search notes by title or content and filter by category for quick access.
- **Categories**: Assign categories to notes for better organization, with a dynamic category filter in the sidebar.
- **Timestamps**: Automatically track creation and modification dates for each note, displayed in a clean format.

### Modern User Interface
- **Light and Dark Themes**: Toggle between light and dark themes with a single click, with preferences saved in the database.
- **Glassy Design**: Features a modern, glassy UI with subtle transparency effects for frames and panels.
- **Custom Widgets**: Includes styled buttons, entries, text areas, listboxes, and labels with hover effects and theme integration.
- **Responsive Layout**: Uses a sidebar for note navigation and a main editor panel, with a resizable window (minimum 900x600 pixels).
- **Welcome Screen**: Displays a visually appealing welcome message with a quick action button to create new notes when no note is selected.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Animated-like transitions when switching between note and task modes or toggling themes.

### Task Management
- **Task View**: Add, edit, mark as done, or delete tasks within a note, with a scrollable task list.
- **Interactive Checkboxes**: Tasks have modern checkboxes that toggle completion status, with strikethrough text for completed tasks.
- **Add Task Interface**: A dedicated input field and button for adding new tasks, with Enter key support for quick entry.

### Technical Features
- **SQLite Database**: Stores notes, tasks, and settings in a lightweight, file-based database.
- **Data Classes**: Uses Python dataclasses for clean, type-hinted note and task models.
- **Theme Management**: Centralized theme configuration with a `ThemeManager` class for consistent color application.
- **PyInstaller Support**: Compiled into a standalone `.exe` for Windows, bundling all dependencies for easy distribution.
- **Error Handling**: Includes validation (e.g., requiring a note title) and confirmation dialogs for destructive actions like deletion.
- **Auto-Save on Close**: Automatically saves the current note when closing the app, if it has a title.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Windows Operating System**: The app is compiled as a Windows executable.
- **Python 3.12 or 3.13** (for development or running from source):
  - Required for compatibility with `pyinstaller` and other dependencies.

2. **Run the Executable**:
   - Double-click the `.exe` file to launch the app.
   - The app will create a `notes.db` file in the same directory to store your notes.
3. **Optional: Move the Executable**:
   - Place the `.exe` in a dedicated folder to keep the database and app together.

### Running from Source
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/note-taking-app.git
   cd note-taking-app
   ```
2. **Install Poetry**:

## Dependencies
- **Python Libraries** (managed via Poetry):
  - `tkinter`: For the GUI (included in Python standard library).
  - `sqlite3`: For database storage (included in Python standard library).
  - `ruff`: For linting and code formatting.
  - `pyinstaller`: For compiling the app into a Windows executable.
- See `pyproject.toml` for version constraints.

## Building the Executable
To create a new `.exe`:
```bash
poetry run pyinstaller --onefile --name NoteTakingApp app.py
```
- The executable is generated in `dist/NoteTakingApp.exe`.
- Ensure Python 3.12 or 3.13 is used due to `pyinstaller` compatibility.

## Releasing on GitHub
1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml` (e.g., `version = "1.0.0"`).
2. Commit changes and tag the release:
   ```bash
   git commit -am "Bump version to 1.0.0"
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   git push origin main v1.0.0
   ```
3. Create a release on GitHub with `dist/NoteTakingApp.exe`:
   ```bash
   gh release create v1.0.0 dist/NoteTakingApp.exe -t "v1.0.0" -n "Initial release with note and task features"
   ```
